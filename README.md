### We are Team Slowy

Our project goes beyond the current **commercialized service of a community-based shared refrigerator** and plays a role in **supporting the dietary needs of vulnerable populations**, such as basic livelihood recipients. Through this, we can not only **reduce food waste** and **protect the environment**, but also **promote shared prosperity within the local community**. Furthermore, the service can create a virtuous cycle of easy and non-burdensome donation.

## ⭐ Background of the Proposal

### Issues with **Existing Shared Refrigerators**

Amidst the continuous rise in prices, the livelihood of the people is suffering, and **the difficulties faced by low-income vulnerable groups have been further exacerbated**. In an effort to address this issue, problems such as **"food monopolies"** and **"imbalance between recipients and donors"** have arisen in the shared refrigerator project. To solve these problems, it is essential to provide a shared refrigerator service that allows for transparent disclosure of donation and distribution records, and accepts food donations through a reservation system.

### **Donation Transparency**

**"Donors have the right to verify that their donations are being used for their intended purposes."** This is included in the "Declaration of Donor Rights" created by the Korea Association of Fundraising Professionals in 2017. **If people can confirm when and how their donations were used to help others, they will be more likely to donate.**

### **Environmental Issues**

In 2019, the amount of daily household waste generated nationwide was approximately 45,912 tons. Among them, **food waste accounts for 13,138.8 tons, or 28.62% of the total waste generated.** If we can reduce the amount of food waste through donations, we can **also contribute to environmental protection**.

### 1️⃣ **No perverty &** 2️⃣ **Zero hunger**

Currently, in Korea, we provide support for basic welfare recipients and the secondary class. But it's not enough money for them to eat healthy and make a living. If they receive food donations through Hearty-Fridge, they will be able to reduce their food costs and use it to make a living in other areas. If the food is well utilized in the process of receiving donations, it will also solve the problem of hunger.

### 1️⃣2️⃣ **Responsible consumption and production**

Food waste produces greenhouse gas emissions and is economically costly. I believe that if we, as consumers, portion out our food and donate the food that we won't be eating later, we will be able to reduce a lot of food waste.
